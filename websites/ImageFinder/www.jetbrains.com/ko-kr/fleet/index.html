The tools available today have been constructed using layers of technology developed over decades.

The size is dependent on the number of contributors and incoming project reviews. It could range from a small core team of around 5, to a team of 50 or more for larger project groups. Each project group is part of a broader stream with community-wide goals. Apart from the development teams, there are special interest groups like the Operators group, who collaborate and focus on requirements and issues with OpenStack deployments.

When a developer moved from one team to another, which often happens in our case, they wasted extra time learning a new set of tools with no increase in productivity.":"\uC18C\uADDC\uBAA8 \uC870\uC9C1\uC774\uB77C\uB3C4 \uAC01 \uD300\uC774 \uC790\uCCB4\uC801\uC778 \uB3C4\uAD6C \uC138\uD2B8\uB97C \uC120\uD0DD\uD588\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uC608\uB97C \uB4E4\uC5B4 \uC5B4\uB5A4 \uD300\uC740 \uC800\uC7A5\uC18C, CI/CD \uBC0F \uD638\uC2A4\uD305\uC5D0 GitHub\uB97C \uC0AC\uC6A9\uD558\uACE0 \uC774\uC288 \uBC0F \uC2A4\uD504\uB9B0\uD2B8 \uACC4\uD68D\uC5D0 Asana\uB97C \uC0AC\uC6A9\uD558\uB294 \uBC18\uBA74, \uB610 \uB2E4\uB978 \uD300\uC740 \uC800\uC7A5\uC18C \uBC0F CI/CD\uC5D0 GitLab, \uD638\uC2A4\uD305\uC5D0 Vercel, \uC774\uC288 \uBC0F \uC774\uC288 \uCD94\uC801\uC5D0 YouTrack\uC744 \uC0AC\uC6A9\uD569\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uC800\uD76C \uAC19\uC740 \uACBD\uC6B0 \uAC1C\uBC1C\uC790\uAC00 \uD55C \uD300\uC5D0\uC11C \uB2E4\uB978 \uD300\uC73C\uB85C \uC774\uB3D9\uD558\uB294 \uACBD\uC6B0\uAC00 \uB9CE\uC740\uB370, \uADF8\uB7F4 \uB54C\uBA74 \uC0C8\uB85C\uC6B4 \uB3C4\uAD6C \uC138\uD2B8\uB97C \uBC30\uC6B0\uB290\uB77C \uC2DC\uAC04\uC744 \uD5C8\uBE44\uD558\uC5EC \uC77C\uC744 \uC81C\uB300\uB85C \uCC98\uB9AC\uD558\uC9C0 \uBABB\uD569\uB2C8\uB2E4.","Even richer HTTP API, which will be better documented (everything that can be done in the interface, and more, should be exposed via the <0>API). <1/></0>":"\uBB38\uC11C\uD654\uAC00 \uB354\uC6B1 \uAC1C\uC120\uB420 \uB354 \uD48D\uBD80\uD55C HTTP API(\uC778\uD130\uD398\uC774\uC2A4\uC5D0\uC11C \uC218\uD589\uD560 \uC218 \uC788\uB294 \uBAA8\uB4E0 \uC791\uC5C5 \uBC0F \uAE30\uD0C0 \uC791\uC5C5\uC740 API\uB97C \uD1B5\uD574 \uB178\uCD9C\uB418\uC5B4\uC57C <0>\uD568). <1/></0>","Event name":"\uD589\uC0AC \uC774\uB984","Event website":"\uD589\uC0AC \uC6F9\uC0AC\uC774\uD2B8","Events":"\uD589\uC0AC","Events Partnership":"\uD589\uC0AC \uD30C\uD2B8\uB108\uC2ED","Events and Webinars":"\uC774\uBCA4\uD2B8 \uBC0F \uC6F9 \uC138\uBBF8\uB098","Ever since Unidata was founded, its UI team has always been free to choose whichever tools they liked for coding. At the very beginning, they used a number of text editors. In 2018, the team made the decision to look for a more sophisticated solution to help them do their daily work faster. In particular, as the team was doing a lot of code refactoring, they looked for a tool to make that process more efficient. The team came across a lot of positive reviews of WebStorm, so they decided to give it a go. Since then, WebStorm has become a company standard for handling web development tasks and the whole UI team uses it at work on a daily basis.":"Unidata\uAC00 \uC124\uB9BD\uB41C \uC774\uB798 UI \uD300\uC740 \uCF54\uB529\uC5D0 \uC0AC\uC6A9\uD560 \uB3C4\uAD6C\uB97C \uD56D\uC0C1 \uC790\uC720\uB86D\uAC8C \uC120\uD0DD\uD560 \uC218 \uC788\uC5C8\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uCC98\uC74C\uC5D0\uB294 \uC5EC\uB7EC \uD14D\uC2A4\uD2B8 \uC5D0\uB514\uD130\uB97C \uC0AC\uC6A9\uD588\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. 2018\uB144\uC5D0 \uD300\uC740 \uC77C\uC0C1\uC801\uC778 \uC5C5\uBB34\uB97C \uB354 \uBE60\uB974\uAC8C \uC218\uD589\uD560 \uC218 \uC788\uB3C4\uB85D \uBCF4\uB2E4 \uC815\uAD50\uD55C \uC194\uB8E8\uC158\uC744 \uCC3E\uAE30\uB85C \uACB0\uC815\uD588\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uD2B9\uD788 \uB9CE\uC740 \uCF54\uB4DC \uB9AC\uD329\uD130\uB9C1\uC744 \uC218\uD589\uD560 \uB54C \uD504\uB85C\uC138\uC2A4 \uD6A8\uC728\uC744 \uB192\uC5EC\uC904 \uC218 \uC788\uB294 \uB3C4\uAD6C\uAC00 \uD544\uC694\uD588\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4.

This is a story about how we updated our logo. One fine evening the UX designer and I started thinking about a new logo. We came up with a few ideas but none of them were quite right... So we got our CTO over to have a look and give us some feedback, and it turned out that someone on his team had not just an idea for a new logo, but a concept for the whole website. They just didn`t know where to go with it. Next we got the CEO involved, and then everything got serious and had to be made perfect. Then things really took off. Everyone started contributing ideas to the issue, and we came up with sleeve patches and t-shirts, and some gamification ideas to boost our internal metrics. Now we`re putting it all into action.

It provides support for project-wide code style conformance and version control. Many developers also find the quick-fixes quite useful and save a lot of time when fixing small bugs and doing code reformatting. Additionally, the debugging support makes it easier for development teams to verify the feature development. You can also use the Gerrit plugins to manage your code reviews from the IDE itself.":"PyCharm\uC740 \uB300\uBD80\uBD84\uC758 \uC0AC\uC6A9\uC790\uC5D0\uAC8C \uB9E4\uC6B0 \uC798 \uC791\uB3D9\uD558\uBA70 \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8 \uC804\uBC18\uC758 \uCF54\uB4DC \uC2A4\uD0C0\uC77C \uC900\uC218\uC640 \uBC84\uC804 \uAD00\uB9AC\uB97C \uC9C0\uC6D0\uD569\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uB610\uD55C \uB9CE\uC740 \uAC1C\uBC1C\uC790\uB4E4\uC774 \uBE60\uB978 \uC218\uC815\uC744 \uB9E4\uC6B0 \uC720\uC6A9\uD558\uB2E4\uACE0 \uC0DD\uAC01\uD558\uBA70 \uC791\uC740 \uBC84\uADF8\uB97C \uC218\uC815\uD558\uACE0 \uCF54\uB4DC \uC11C\uC2DD\uC744 \uB2E4\uC2DC \uC9C0\uC815\uD560 \uB54C \uB9CE\uC740 \uC2DC\uAC04\uC774 \uC808\uC57D\uB429\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uB610\uD55C \uB514\uBC84\uAE45 \uC9C0\uC6D0\uC744 \uD1B5\uD574 \uAC1C\uBC1C \uD300\uC774 \uAC1C\uBC1C\uD55C \uAE30\uB2A5\uC744 \uBCF4\uB2E4 \uC27D\uAC8C \uAC80\uC99D\uD560 \uC218 \uC788\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4.

It is easy to hit user limits in free versions (e.g. YouTrack has a 10-user limit in the free version). However, Space offers unlimited users and projects in their free plan. There are also higher benefits compared to equivalent tool utilization. For instance, GitLab offers 400 CI minutes in its free plan, while Space provides 2000 CI minutes. We found the free plan in Space to be quite attractive and moved all our team members to Space.

But there was one thing that we noticed \u2013 development team leads often used to have disagreements with project managers about matters like what tasks to work on, and this led to delays in decision-making which slowed down work on projects. Senior management would have to step in to help make decisions, and since the company was growing rapidly, this problem was consuming more and more of their time. To get around the problem, we gave team leads and project managers equal authority and autonomy to define areas of responsibility in projects. There were some difficult discussions and tense retrospectives at first, but now the problem is solved and there`s a definite spirit of partnership and cooperation between development teams. We now have separate, autonomous teams for each project.":"\uACE0\uAC1D\uACFC \uD568\uAED8 \uC77C\uD558\uB294 \uBC29\uC2DD\uC740 \uB9CE\uC774 \uBCC0\uD558\uC9C0 \uC54A\uC558\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uADF8\uB7EC\uB098 \uC6B0\uB9AC\uAC00 \uD55C \uAC00\uC9C0 \uC54C\uAC8C \uB41C \uC0AC\uC2E4\uC774 \uC788\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uAC1C\uBC1C \uD300\uC7A5\uC740 \uC5B4\uB5A4 \uC791\uC5C5\uC744 \uC218\uD589\uD574\uC57C \uD558\uB294\uC9C0\uC640 \uAC19\uC740 \uBB38\uC81C\uB97C \uB193\uACE0 \uC2EC\uC2EC\uCE58 \uC54A\uAC8C \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8 \uAD00\uB9AC\uC790\uC640 \uC758\uACAC\uC774 \uC77C\uCE58\uD558\uC9C0 \uC54A\uC558\uACE0, \uC774\uB85C \uC778\uD574 \uC758\uC0AC \uACB0\uC815\uC774 \uC9C0\uC5F0\uB418\uBA74\uC11C \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8 \uC9C4\uD589\uC774 \uB354\uB38C\uC84C\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uACE0\uC704 \uACBD\uC601\uC9C4\uC774 \uC758\uC0AC \uACB0\uC815\uC744 \uC704\uD574 \uC9C1\uC811 \uB098\uC11C\uC57C \uD588\uACE0 \uD68C\uC0AC\uAC00 \uBE60\uB974\uAC8C \uC131\uC7A5\uD558\uBA74\uC11C \uC774 \uBB38\uC81C\uB85C \uC778\uD55C \uC2DC\uAC04 \uC190\uC2E4\uC740 \uC810\uC810 \uCEE4\uC84C\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uBB38\uC81C\uB97C \uD574\uACB0\uD558\uAE30 \uC704\uD574 \uD300\uC7A5\uACFC \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8 \uAD00\uB9AC\uC790\uC5D0\uAC8C \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8\uC758 \uCC45\uC784 \uC601\uC5ED\uC744 \uC2A4\uC2A4\uB85C \uC815\uD560 \uC218 \uC788\uB294 \uB3D9\uB4F1\uD55C \uAD8C\uD55C\uACFC \uC790\uC728\uC131\uC744 \uBD80\uC5EC\uD588\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uCC98\uC74C\uC5D0\uB294 \uC5B4\uB824\uC6B4 \uB17C\uC7C1\uACFC \uAE34\uC7A5\uB41C \uC21C\uAC04\uB4E4\uC774 \uC788\uC5C8\uC9C0\uB9CC \uC774\uC81C\uB294 \uBB38\uC81C\uAC00 \uD574\uACB0\uB418\uC5C8\uACE0 \uAC1C\uBC1C\uD300 \uC0AC\uC774\uC5D0 \uD30C\uD2B8\uB108\uC2ED\uACFC \uD611\uB825\uC758 \uBD84\uC704\uAE30\uAC00 \uBB34\uB974\uC775\uC5C8\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4. \uC774\uC81C \uAC01 \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8\uB9C8\uB2E4 \uBCC4\uB3C4 \uD300\uC774 \uBC30\uC815\uB418\uC5B4 \uC790\uC728\uC801\uC73C\uB85C \uC6B4\uC601\uB429\uB2C8\uB2E4.","The zip file holds several MPS plugins, three of which are essential:":"zip \uD30C\uC77C\uC5D0\uB294 \uBA87 \uAC00\uC9C0 MPS \uD50C\uB7EC\uADF8\uC778\uC774 \uD3EC\uD568\uB418\uC5B4 \uC788\uC73C\uBA70, \uADF8 \uC911 \uD544\uC218\uC801\uC778 3\uAC00\uC9C0\uB294 \uB2E4\uC74C\uACFC \uAC19\uC2B5\uB2C8\uB2E4.","Themes":"\uD14C\uB9C8","Theoretical Computer Science":"\uC774\uB860 \uCEF4\uD4E8\uD130 \uACFC\uD559","There are a lot of things that it does much better than Xcode that save me a lot of time programming.":"Xcode\uBCF4\uB2E4 \uD6E8\uC52C \uB354 \uB6F0\uC5B4\uB09C \uAE30\uB2A5\uC774 \uB9CE\uC544\uC11C \uD504\uB85C\uADF8\uB798\uBC0D \uC2DC\uAC04\uC774 \uD06C\uAC8C \uC808\uC57D\uB418\uC8E0.","There are multiple streams of Python development in OpenStack teams.

He was one of the first to start using IntelliJ IDEA. Back then, they were a team of 3 who worked only on backend tasks. As Varij and his colleagues began to build the frontend part of IT Manufactory\u2019s main product, they faced the need to introduce more and more breaking changes under the hood. This made the entire team look for a solution that would help them make those changes without actually breaking anything.
